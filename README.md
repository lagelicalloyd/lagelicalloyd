### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**Things I love:**

My family

My dog Jackie (born in 2009, so respect your elders)

Black History and Empowerment

Asian Cuisine (although, I probably have never had the really good authentic stuff)

Fitness (but not right now, because I've gained some quarantine weight LOL)

Anywho, that's enough personal facts for you.
